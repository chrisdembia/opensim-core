OpenSim Core [![Build Status][buildstatus_image]][travisci]
============ 

OpenSim is software that lets users develop models of musculoskeletal
structures and create dynamic simulations of movement.

More information can be found at our websites:

* [SimTK project website](https://simtk.org/home/opensim)

This repository contains the source code for OpenSim's C++ libraries, C++
examples, command-line applications (inverse kinematics, computed muscle
control, etc.), and Java and Python wrapping.


Build Instructions
------------------
Building from source is difficult and we have limited resource to support 
it. Instructions can be found online at:
