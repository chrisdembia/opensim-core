#                               succeeds.
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_ROOT_DIR            The installation directory.
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_LIB_DIR             The directory containing libraries.
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_INCLUDE_DIRS        Suitable for link_directories().
#   @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@Simbody_INCLUDE_DIRS Suitable for link_directories(). Includes
#                               the Simbody include directories.
